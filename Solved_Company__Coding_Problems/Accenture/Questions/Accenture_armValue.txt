ARM VALUE

Given an array containing positive integers,you have to find the arm value associated with array.

Understand how you can find the arm value:

1)if the sum of odd numbers is odd then return positive difference of | sum of even numbers - sum of odd numbers |
2)If the sum of odd numbers is even then return  | sum of even numbers + sum of odd numbers |

example:

input:{1,2,3,4,5}
output:3
explanation:sum of odd numbers(1+3+5) is 9 wwhich is odd so return position integer (6-9) is 3 answer.

input:{0,2,3,4,5}
output:14
